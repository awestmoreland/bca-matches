# West MI BCA Pool League - Monday Night Singles Matches, 2023

## Problem
Main site has tons of data to scroll through as old matches are not removed or collapsed.

## Solution
Scrape date from page, and display a "quick glance" of the current week's matches, with the option to look at past or future matches.


## Good
* Easy to read

## Bad
* Will break if source site markup changes

## To do
* Improve styling
* Pull Fargo ratings from fargorate.com (not likely without API)
* Calculate races based on Fargo ratings (see above)
